=head1 CONFIGURATION

tasknc honors a config file located at 

    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tasknc/config

or, if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME doesnt exist,

    $HOME/.config/tasknc/config

An example config can be found at /usr/share/tasknc/config.

The configuration file contains a series of commands, which follow the format of the commands listed below.

=head1 COMMANDS

Commands are either supplied at the command prompt or listed in the configuration file.  They are used to configure tasknc to behave as you desire.

=over 4

=item B<add> creates a new task and opens it for editing.

=item B<bind> I<mode> I<key> I<function> I<args> assign I<function> to run every time a I<key> is pressed in I<mode>.  Defining I<key>s is described in the KEYS section.  I<function>s are anything listed in COMMANDS.

=item B<color> I<object> I<foreground> I<background> I<rule> assign an I<object> to be a color when I<rule> is satisfied.  Only task I<object>s evaluate I<rule>s.  The following objects are available:

=over 4

=item I<error>  - error messages

=item I<header> - title bar & pager title

=item I<task>   - tasks in task list

=back

=item Colors are specified in one of three formats:

=over 4

=item I<integer> - number of the color you desire, where -1 is default.

=item I<colorNNN> - where NNN is the color you desire in 3 digits.

=item I<color string> - where the following colors are recognized: I<black>, I<red>, I<green>, I<yellow>, I<blue>, I<magenta>, I<cyan>, and I<white>.

=back

=item Rules are specified in the following format: ~I<pattern> I<arg>.  Pattern is a single character; if lowercase it indicates a positive match, and if uppercase it indicates a negative match.  Regular expression arguments must be enclosed in single quotes.  The following patterns are available:

=over 4

=item I<s>         - task is selected

=item I<t>         - task is started

=item I<p> 'I<regex>' - project matches regex

=item I<d> 'I<regex>' - description matches regex

=item I<t> 'I<regex>' - tags match regex

=item I<r> 'I<regex>' - priority matches regex

=back

=item B<command> I<optarg> runs the command I<optarg> or prompts the user for a command with no arg.

=item B<complete> marks selected task as complete

=item B<delete> deletes selected task

=item B<edit> opens task for editing

=item B<dump> will write active task info to the log file.  This is mostly for debugging.

=item B<scrdump> will write the ncurses screen dump to file.  This is mostly for debugging.

=item B<filter> applies filter string I<optarg> or prompts user for a filter string with no arg.

=item B<f_redraw> force a redraw of theh whole screen.

=item B<help> will open the help window, which will list keybinds.

=item B<quit> will exit tasknc.

=item B<reload> will force tasknc to re-import the task list.

=item B<scroll_down> moves the cursor down

=item B<scroll_end> moves the cursor to the end of the task list

=item B<scroll_home> moves the cursor to the first task

=item B<scroll_up> moves the cursor up

=item B<search> I<optarg> searches task list for string I<optarg> or prompts user for a search string with no arg.

=item B<search_next> goes to the next item in the task list that matches the search string.

=item B<set> I<variable> I<value> will attempt to set I<variable> to a parsed I<value>.  A list of available I<variable>s are listed in the VARIABLES section.

=item B<shell> I<command> will run an interactive command.  A %s will be replaced with the active task's uuid.  The task list will be reloaded after.

=item B<shell_bg> I<command> will run a background command.  A %s will be replaced with the active task's uuid.  The task list will be reloaded after.

=item B<show> I<variable> will print the formatted contents of I<variable> to either stdout or the prompt area of the ncurses window.

=item B<sort> I<optarg> applies a sort defined by string I<optarg> or prompts user for sort mode with no arg.  The sort string defines the priority of each sort component.  Tasks will first be compared by the first character's order, if they are equal, the next characters sort order will be evaluated.  The default sort order is due, priority, project, uuid (notated drpu).  Capitalized characters indicate invert the sort for that field.  The following characters are valid sorts:
